# Modbus RTU Server

A server application capable of communicating with a serial port that
converts RS485 (such as [Serial Server H305](https://www.holykell.com/products/Serial_Server_H305.html))

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project is written in Java, uses Maven as a build tool and MySQL/MariaDB as a database
- [Setup JDK for development](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-java-development-kit-jdk-on-windows-mac-and-linux/)
- [Setup Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html)
- [Setup MySQL](https://overiq.com/installing-mysql-windows-linux-and-mac/)

### Installing

If you're only interested in docker, please scroll to [Using Docker](#using-docker)

Clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/Hathoute/modbus-server

Switch to project directory

    cd modbus-server

Resolve and download dependencies 

    mvn dependency:resolve

Create server jar (skipping tests for now)

    mvn install -DskipTests

Before continuing, please configure your environment (port, database, ...) by following
[Configuring the environment](#configuring-the-environment).

Start the server

    java -jar modbus-server.jar

Upon launching the server, if the database does not exist, the server creates one.

## Configuring the environment

You can easily configure the server without having to alter any java file.
The `properties` file is located under `./src/main/resources/modbus-server.properties`

|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| server.port             |               Server port for devices to connect to               |
| server.use_rtu_over_tcp |          Use RTU over TCP when communicating with modbus          |
| database.hostname       |                         Database hostname                         |
| database.user           |                         Database username                         |

| database.database_name  |                           Database name                           |
| debug.show_value        | Display metric value when reading registers, useful for debugging |

You can also use `environment variables` to set these properties, which the program
prioritizes.

|:------------------------|:------------------------|
| server.port             | SERVER_PORT             |
| server.use_rtu_over_tcp | SERVER_USE_RTU_OVER_TCP |
| database.hostname       | DATABASE_HOSTNAME       |
| database.user           | DATABASE_USER           |

## Dashboard

This project comes with a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) dashboard that you can import to
easily manage devices and view metrics: [Modbus Node-RED flow](node-red-flow.json)

## Using Docker

You can find a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the root directory 
of this project to build a docker image, and an example of a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
to run this project.

## Dependencies

This project is using a modified version of [j2mod modbus library](https://github.com/steveohara/j2mod)
that enables acting as a server on top of being able to query data as a client/master.
